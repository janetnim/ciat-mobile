# ciat-mobile
A mobile application for capturing images and running flower count prediction.
To run the repo:

- Clone the repository locally and checkout to the cloned folder

- Install node packages via `yarn install`

- On your phone, go to the playstore and install Expo which we will use to serve the app

- Then start the app: `npx expo start`. A QR code will be generated and you can use the expo app scan feature to load the application and test. You can also start the app via the commands: `yarn android`
or `yarn ios` to start the app in android and ios modes

- Ensure the [backend](https://github.com/janetnim/ciat-backend/README.md) is also running to consume the APIs
